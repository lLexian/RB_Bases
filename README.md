# FAQ

Q: How do i use these bases?

A: These bases are .json files used with the 'Raidable Bases' plugin for a Oxide modded Rust server. Download and Intructions for 'Raidable Bases' can be found here: https://umod.org/plugins/raidable-bases

Q: Who are these bases designed for?

A: These bases are designed to replicate a typical base you would find on a vanilla Rust server. Primarily they will be used to imitate player activity on a low-pop/locally hosted server.

Q: Why are there multiple variants of each base?

A: The reason why there are 5 different variants of the 2x1 is because not every Rust player builds the exact same 2x1. Some players only use wood doors, some players upgrade to sheet metal and some players are lucky enough to find a garage door. With the 2x2 being an example, players can make the decision to either door raid or wall raid. That allows players to take a gamble while raiding doors. If all 2x2's were the exact same design, players could easily discover the cheapest route and it would become repetitive very quickly.

Q: Some walls are backwards and items are placed in incorrect locations.

A: The majority of these bases have been build in Fortify. Fortify isn't perfect and i'm still learning the quirks and bugs. For example, something i didn't realise until after designing a couple bases is that the Research Table is placed much further back in-game compared to in Fortify, so in some cases the Research Table is sticking out of the wall. As for backwards walls, I typically create bases in bulk and test 1 or 2 in game. As of writing this i haven't done testing on each base, so there may be some flaws i havn't fixed yet.
